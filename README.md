# About the Fork
This project was forked from [VulHunter](https://github.com/Secbrain/VulHunter) for independent evaluation as part of master thesis "Machine Learning for Vulnerability Detection in Smart Contracts A Comparison of Approaches".

It provides the following infrastructural changes for integration into [SmartBugs](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs):
- Added [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) configuration installing all dependencies and also solc
- We install python dependencies from scratch, because the provided venv is corrupted
- Replaced the included solc binaries, some of which were corrupted and produced segmentation faults on execution
- Provided a Dockerfile
- Added missing fonts, which prevented the PDF report from being printed
- Added logging of exceptions in case of solc compilation errors
- Added writing of the JSON vulnerability report to a file additionally to stdout
